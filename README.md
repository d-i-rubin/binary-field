# binary-field
Mathematical algorithms for use with finite fields of characteristic 2 in cryptography.

Contains efficient implementations of the analogue of the Number Theoretic Transform over binary fields as described in [Lin et al, "Novel polynomial basis and its application to Reed-Solomon erasure codes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3458). These techniques are used to implement the FRI protocol ([Ben-Sasson et al, "FRI: Fast Reed-Solomon interactive oracle proofs of proximity"](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol107-icalp2018/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.14/LIPIcs.ICALP.2018.14.pdf)).
